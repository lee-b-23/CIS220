The enigma machine is meant to encode messages.  The three gears represent
the set of characters that can be put into the machine.  If you rotate a gear,
the output for a given letter will be changed.  The plugboard is used to pair
scramble letters by swapping paired letters as they appear in the message.

The program was made by Lee Brown as a final project for his Object-Oriented
Programming course at Manchester Community College.  If you would like to
